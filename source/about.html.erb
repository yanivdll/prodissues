<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome to my site. My name is Yaniv, and my weblog serves as a personal experiment with writing, telling stories and sharing the things I'm learning or finding interesting.</p>

<p>This site centers on topics related to product leadership, user experience, and design, but I also write about anything I feel passionate about, such as Apple stuff, productivity, automation and... coffee. I write here for my own amusement, and hopefully you'll find spending time here worthwhile.</p>

<!-- <p> You'll find there isn't way to leave comments. It's intentional, but not because I don't welcome feedback, ideas and opinions. I just don't to become a moderator, since 99% of comments are spam at best, heresment at worst. So please feel free to contact me whenever, or bring the discussion over to twitter.</p>

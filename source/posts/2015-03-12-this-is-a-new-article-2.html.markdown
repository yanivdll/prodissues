## The Essay 
### Construction

### Draft 1
Parents for toddlers and young children living in my neighborhood will benefit from the creation of public indoor playgrounds. Unlike outdoors playground, which are closed during the winter, indoor playground are open year round, so parents can take their kids play even in the cold weather. Furthermore, indoor parks can be more secure. A single guard at the entrance to an indoor playground can restrict access to only parents with kids and make sure that kids don't leave the playground without their parents. Thus, indoor playgrounds may provide peace of mind to the neighborhood parents. Lastly, the development of indoor playgrounds will attract more families to our neighborhood. Parents would love having additional families with kids joining to their neighborhood, because they can have more opportunities to schedule playdates and socialize with other parents. Therefore, investing in the creation of public indoor playground will make a big difference for parents in my neighborhood.


## Self assessment of paragraph assignment 
- Not sure if the construction of the second support sentence is good. It start by referring to the improvement, and not to how it will benefit the community. I tried different variations, but this one seem to be the most effective. Yet not sure if it's the best wording.
- I didn't include examples, which is the point of illustrative essay...

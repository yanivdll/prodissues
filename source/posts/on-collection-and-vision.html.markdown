Marimekko is one of my favorite stores[^store]. Whenever I go into that store, I get filled with excitement and an urge to swallow its entire collection. I'm fascinated by the vibrant colors and the unique, yet simple, patterns. I'm compelled by the layout of the store and by the arrangement of the items. All I want when I'm there is to buy everything, and turn my home to an exact replica of that store.

Unfortunately, I can't afford taking over the store yet, and even if I could, I don't know what would I do with hundreds of yards of beautiful fabric[^fabric]. And so I have to limit my focus to only one, maybe a couple of items at a time. But when doing so, much of the early excitement vanishes.

When looking at each of the items separately, they don't look as compelling . A colorful serving plate loses its charm when I figure it won't fit our current portfolio of dull white dinnerware. A Puisto-osasto print bag is beautiful, only until I see it's a tote style bag, which I would never dare to carry. A sofa pillow with colorful flowers' print that is Marimekko's signature is stunning, yet won't make it to our subtle, minimalist living room. 

So beautiful as a whole, less so when zooming in. And so I usually leave the store empty handed (sometimes with yet another espresso cup). 

I use this metaphor occasionally when talking about the difference between vision and the  parts that make this vision a whole. I use it to explain to my team why is it that an inspiring vision turns into a list of less  exciting projects: improving our api by exposing more resource types, or adding more and attributes to existing ones; keeping high standards with our internal tools, even though they're not adding direct value to our users; putting design resources and developing pixel perfect reporting dashboards. These are efforts that don't always make sense if you look at them in disjunction from the bigger picture, and see how they become a comprehensive  product in aggregate.

At other times I use it to give some perspective to a feature owner who feels disappointed when the feature she just released didn't take  the Internet by storm. I explain that when building a comprehensive platform, it's unlikely that a single feature will "steel the show".

A vision, like the Marimekko store, excites and inspires only when viewed in its entirety. When you dive into the details,  the products and features that comprise it, you might loose your initial enthusiasm. 

If you're in a leadership position, remember that while you live and breath vision, your team is soaked in the details, and in the day to day tedious work that is anything but exciting. Your challenge will be to respire them, and keep them inhaling the dream. Otherwise your team might lose the moral and motivation that are important to build toward your vision.

Hey guys,
Wanted to share with you some of my thoughts following the meetings we had with Gilad, and one that Hili and I had couple of days ago.

# Walk through the thought process
* Started from product vision
* To think vision we have to spen time together
* To have time we have to move ourselves from the day to day
* To do so we have to grow our people to me more independent
* That means that what Gilad said in the first meeting did actually make sense

# Problems 
I see the problems that we experience divided into two types or directions:

## Upstream - top management
* lack of authority 
* prioritization - too many asks and no patient to let things developed
* no definitive KPIs

## Downstream - our product team and R&D
* We don't feel our peers at R&D have the same level of sense of urgency, feel of ownership, motivation as _we think_ we have.
* We don't execute fast enough
*  We don't have high standard for what is an MVP let alone product.
*  The quality of our product is poor
*  We're not proud of the features we're shipping
*  Our product don't meet the expectations (at least not the expectations of its stakeholders)

# The source to these problems
- **TRUST**
	* the biggest issue that we have to solve for it trust.


Why improving trust is the most important thing

How

Trust is our KPI
This is the only thing that 

We must restore the trust

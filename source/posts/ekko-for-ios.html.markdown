[Ekko](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ekko-Player/id969512337) is a useful little app letting you interact with content using natural language. I'm working with Intelligence Interactive, the startup that developed the app, to productize its voice-casting technology. Ekko is the first fruit of this work. It was just released, and getting some [warm reviews](http://9to5mac.com/2015/04/30/ekko-player-ios/).

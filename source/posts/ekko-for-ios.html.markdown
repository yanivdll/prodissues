[Ekko](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ekko-Player/id969512337) is a true "news reader" app - it actually reads the news to you. Not only will it speak headlines and stories, but it will also listen to your voice instructions. Say "headlines", and it will read the top headlines; "play"[^1], and it will read an entire article; "ekko" and it will stop reading and wait for your next instruction. It's like having Siri as your personal news anchor.

The company that developed Ekko is Intelligence Interactive. It's a small NYC based startup, and I'm part of its advisory board. My help revolve mainly around product strategy, and Ekko is the first fruit of that collaboration. There's hardly anything as satisfying as turning an idea into a real product, especially one that's getting [warm reviews](http://9to5mac.com/2015/04/30/ekko-player-ios/).

[^1]: When you say "play", you should add a keyword from the headline, so Ekko can infer which headline you're trying to select.

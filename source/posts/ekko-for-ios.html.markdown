I've recently worked with a small NYC based startup called Intelligence Interactive, helping productize their voicecasting technology. [Ekko](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ekko-Player/id969512337) is he first outcome of this work. It's a useful little app letting you interact with content using natural language. Ekko was realeased couple of weeks ago, and now getting some [warm reviews](http://9to5mac.com/2015/04/30/ekko-player-ios/).

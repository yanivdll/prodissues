If you are reading this sentence, it means that I proved my point without even getting you through the rest of the article.

Just came back from a run, which reminded me the one principle I etched in my mind as one of the mottos I live by. 

I didn't really want to go running today. I had an eventful weekend, which included many miles of walking. I was tired and hungry and above all had a presentation for a lecture I'm giving tomorrow, which I had to finalize. Many good reasons to call it a day and give up this one run. After all I run 3-4 times a week; skipping one session won't be the end of the world.

But then again, giving up on even one session is a slippery slope. You resonate it once, and soon you find even better explanations why you shouldn't have the next run, and the one after. Before you know it, you're not running anymore. So no, I wasn't willing to give up this one. 

To overcome my weariness I set myself with a humble goal - put running shoes on. I then pleaded myself to walk out the door and take a short run. Any distance, I promised myself will do. Even a mile or two will be better than not running at all. It worked. As soon as I took few steps the magic began. My earlier fatigue evaporated and I began to feel invigorated, a feeling that strengthen as I gulped more steps. After a mile I had no doubt that I'll run my regular 3 miles. 

So far, nothing special. I'm used to that routing. Every time I have to do something I'm not very excited about, like reply to a long email, write a new blog post, or take the dishes out of the dish washer, I have to deliberate and negotiate with that side of me that wants to rest, relax and drink coffee. The most effective weapon I use to make the right move and avoid procrastination is taking the smallest possible step. Click the "reply" button, write the first line of the potential post, or open the dish washer door. Chances are that a small step is enough to push you to complete the task altogether.

But today's run was special, in that it illustrated how powerful the "small step" mantra proved to be. 

As I mentioned, after pushing myself to take few steps, I quickly changed my plans and decided to run my regular distance. But suddenly, before getting half way to that goal, I felt a boost of energy. I don't know where this energy came from, maybe an idea I got for the presentation I had worked on, but it made me feel an urge to keep running. I now wanted to hit 5 miles. Remarkably, when I got to the 5 miles turning point, I wanted to go even further. I didn't though, because I had to go back home, as dinner was on its way[^seamless].

Now, think about it: from not wanting to run to running 5 miles. All because I convinced myself to wear shoes! Nike's slogan "Just do it" is sheer inspiration. Yet it doesn't solve for how to push yourself to just do it. Taking a small, modest and non-commuting step might be more effective to make you getting things done. But I'm not saying anything new here. Much was already written about the power of a small step. There is an entire methodology\philosophy, called Kaizen[^Kaizen], that is built around this concept. All I'm saying is that it works.

Back to the first sentence of this post. I though about it while running, I also figured it might make an interesting post. But by the time I got home, had dinner and set to finish my presentation, I was too tired to start a new writeup. I also wasn't too encouraged to do it, given the finale of my run (more wasn't this shortly). I did convinced myself, though, to write only one sentence. What I came up with was what's now the opening line of this post. 

Now let me conclude with an anti-climax. This run again. I got to the 2.5 miles mark and turned back for the second half. But then, about a mile before the finish line, my legs failed me, and without consultation just stopped moving. I was able to clump back home, confused whether I should be happy that I didn't gave up this run or disappointed that after all this excitement I stopped before reaching my goal.

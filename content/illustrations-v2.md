In an [earlier post](http://prodissues.com/2016/12/some-illustration-fun.html) I shared some of my illustrations for [Baby Weatr](http://m.me/1800370993514871), a Messenger app that helps parents chose an outfit for their newborn baby based on the weather. As I gained more experience in illustrations (note: I'm not a designer), a style started to emerge. Here are the outcomes of the second iterations.

I created most of those illustrations in [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org), while transitioning to [Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). Finally, I then used [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) to create complete outfits (see example at the bottom of this post).

These are the styles we're using in the app:

ids="1062,1064,1065,1066,1067,1069,1070,1071,1072,1073,1074,1075"\]

 

And here's how items then added to a complete outfit:

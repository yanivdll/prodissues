So this idea that I had. I was talking with a company that is doing
personalization for jobs - UpScored. I knew Elise, their CEO, from
twitter and gave their newly launched product a spin. I came back with
some feedback, and after a good chat with Elise, I realized that the
problem I'm working on my day-to-day - personalization engine for
content, is relevant for other fields as well.

A day later, I was introduced to on of the co-founders of Plated - a
meal planning service. He's story, of how they've started the company,
reminded me a lot of how and why I've started FeedMe - a marketplace for
food company that I started about 5 years ago and close about a year
later. He was talking about Plated as a food-tech company, while I was
struggling what technology had to do with the service, other than having
a consumer facing website.

Anyway, at that point I was doing one plus one in my head, and the idea
to develop a true technological approach to food discovery popped up. I
want to develop an app that will tell **me** what I want to eat. Let me
offer some context, though.

While food related technologies and services proliferate, the simple
question of "what to eat?" becomes harder than ever.

Here's an example: last weekend I went to Austin, for the SXSW festival.
I landed on Friday morning, and headed downtown for breakfast. I opened
Yelp, to "discover" what I should be eating. But after looking into the
first 5 results (out of hundreds), I became hungrier and less patient,
so I picked up the first restaurant that I saw across the street, and
which seemed decent. Yelp didn't help me to "discover" the best of
Austin.

Another example: Every night (no exaggerations), I have the same dialog
with my wife:

So the problem is that not being able to choose what to eat takes the
fun out of the food experience. I want an app, or a service that will
take the decision for me, based on my history, my taste, my diet and
that's of my partner for the order.

I spent the previous week researching, brainstorming with friends,
wire-framing and what not, and got a long way in defining the problem
and focusing the approach for the solution. More on it in following
posts.

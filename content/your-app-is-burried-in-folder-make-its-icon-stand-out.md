Meetup has finally updated its mobile app. More than that, it went
through a complete re-branding, and as part of it also redesigned the
icon of its mobile app.

From the look of the new icon, it seems that Meetup's designers assumed
their app sits front and center in their users' devices. I hesitate
that's the case.

I'm one of those users... while I use the Meetup app quite often, to
stay in touch and communicate with members of the groups I lead, it's
not one of the few apps I spend most of my time on. Therefore Meetup,
like 98% of my apps, lives in a folder.

As a foldered app, it should have an icon that's visually
distinguishable, and that stands out with every pixel, otherwise users
will ignore the app and won't use it. Meetup's new icon is anything but
standing out. On the contrary - it blends with the rest of the icons and
lacks identity.

Take a look at Meetup's icon before and after:

<span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span> Left - before, Right -
after. In both images, it's in the top-right folder, the bottom-right
icon

The previous icon, while not optimized for mobile - having to squeeze
the name in the small icon - had some color contrast to it, which made
it recognizable.


## Your App Is Not Special

Don't assume users care about your app; they don't. After downloading
it, they are likely to either delete it, or throw it into a folder. The
least you can do is plan for the latter, and design an icon that's
unique, and can be recognized in any size.

Take a look again at the screenshots above - which icons do better job
at grabbing your attention, even when placed within a
folder[^1]?

[^1]: My pick would be the **Workflow's** icon (same folder as Meetup,
bottom-left corner), as well as **Spotify** (right image, top-left
folder, top-left icon) and **Overcast** (right image, top-left folder,
mid-left icon).

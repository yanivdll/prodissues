Awhile back I wrote about my experience [learning to touch
type](http://prodissues.com/2015/10/on-touch-typing-and-failure.html).
While writing it, I found [this related
article](//sachachua.com/blog/2011/09/deliberate-practice-typing-faster-and-emacs/)
by Sacha Chua, which helped me rationalize to myself *why* it is such an
important skill to learn. I ended up spending almost an hour browsing
Sacha's site. The amount of resources, posts, tips and tutorials that
she shares is humongous!

Now, it's not that I wouldn't have landed on her blog at some point. Few
days earlier, I had started my Emacs adventure. As it turned out, Sacha
writes *alot* about Emacs, and is super involved in the Emacs community.
So now I had two reasons to listen to what she has to say.

Yet, that wasn't all. Both touch-typing and Emacs were only means to an
end, that end being writing. I wanted to write better and blog more
often. And so, when I landed on Sacha's ["No Excuses For
Blogging"](http://sachachua.com/blog/series/a-no-excuses-guide-to-blogging/)
ebook, I was intrigued.

After reading just a couple of chapters, I dropped everything, including
that book, and started writing. I didn't stop since. Reading this book
was like cracking a hole in a wall that kept my thoughts caged within my
head. Without exaggerations, here's how reading this book felt:

Not only that Sacha articulates the excuses that stopped me from writing
so accurately, but the tips and tricks to overcome those excuses are dead
simple and easy to follow. You don't know where to start a post? write
it as an answer to an email. You want to write about something, but not
sure you know enough? write about what you don't know, and document the
way you go about learning it. Can't decide *what* you should write
about? don't decide; just write about whatever you're doing or learning.
Focus will come in time, and by that time you're already a blogger.

And Sacha's site is a perfect implementation of her own tips and tricks.
It feels like her blog mirroring what goes inside her head, and that's
exactly how I wanted my writing to be - fully synced with my thoughts.

So here are few of the things I've learned and implemented as a result
of reading that book:

## "I don't know what to write about"

-   I create an entry for everything I want to learn, explore or
    do[^1]. Not only that it creates an endless
    pool of ideas, but it also keeps me focused, by forcing me to
    document the path of exploration.
-   I keep those entries in one org file, called `posts_drafts`. My goal
    is to develop each of those entries to a blog post.
-   This draft file is public. [Here it
    is](http://prodissues.com/2015/11/drafts.html).


## "There's much I *can't* write about"

-   I've stopped waiting until I know the in-and-out of a subject before
    writing about it. I found that when I get to that point, I'm not
    interested anymore at going back and write about it. Instead, I
    document the journey toward that knowledge. Not only that I write
    and post more often, but its a better way to retain what I learn. A
    fun way I think about documenting while learning is kinda like
    running:


``` sh
git commit -a -m "[post content]"
git push master brain/master
```


## "I don't know where to start"

-   I use Sacha's tip to phrase my posts as an answer to a question, or
    an email. Usually, the question, and the subject of the entry I put
    in the draft file is the search term I google. This habit helps me
    stay focused on the subject and the point I'm trying to make.

## "I feel scattered and distracted"

-   I don't try to create a theme for my blog. Instead, I try to write
    and post as much as possible. No one is going to read my blog post
    by post, and so there is no reason to think of it like a list of
    sequential posts.

This short book helped me more than many of the books I read about
writing in general, and blogging in particular. It also inspired me to
start a [Blog Writing meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Blog-writing/), and
circle myself with people who write for their living.

So, if you're looking for ways to overcome your blogging
procrastination, or just get some pithy writing tips, do yourself a
favor, and make sure to read that book.

Couple of weeks ago I was vacationing with my family at the Dominican Republic. One night, at about midnight, while I was lying half asleep in-front of the TV, watching a show about Vietnam on the Discovery Channel (the only English channel), I caught this quote:

> We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring
> will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first
> time.

This line stirred me, and I had to find the source. It was taken from T.S Eliot's poem - [Little Gidding](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/history/winter/w3206/edit/tseliotlittlegidding.html).

The next day, I read the entire poem. It wasn't an easy read[^1], but several more parts of it moved me just as much. Here are couple of them:

> ... last year's words belong to last year's language And next year's
> words await another voice.

> Let me disclose the gifts reserved for age ... Second, the conscious
> impotence of rage At human folly, and the laceration Of laughter at
> what ceases to amuse.

Mysterious are the ways of knowledge and inspiration... one should
always be willing and ready to absorb more of them...

Thank god it's over.

Long time ago I pledged not to put down a book I started reading. I tend
to read at least couple of books in parallel, and if not being
disciplined, I can easily focus on one and drop the other. I might then
start yet another one, and forget about the other two.

"The Myth Of Sisyphus" almost got me to break this rule, though I
haven't. It wasn't my "avoids putting a book down" principle that kept
me going, but the book's underling idea - the absurd life, the poignant
quotes it is packed with, and the wealth of references it makes to other
writers and books. Timing contributed as well, as this book came in a
relevant time in life.

And so, I wanted to read what Camus had to say, but his writing style is
annoying, verbose, and too abstract. Too often Camus will go in circles,
to a point where I lost his line of thought. His writing style, and the
way he structures his sentences are awful, making me read the same
paragraphs over and over again, trying to comprehend what in havens he
meant to say.

As eager I was to wrap my head around absurdism, I wouldn't have made it
without the excellent help of

(I did skip the adjoining essays. It was too much...)

> The central concern of The Myth of Sisyphus is what Camus calls "the

But put writing style aside, the absurd is a thought provoking idea, and
I can see why it was so influential. It raises a lot of questions,
leading me to think about life in ways I never did before. However,
while doing so, it doesn't provide satisfying, practical answers. And
so, the book delineates the philosophy it manifests, in that it helped
me asking questions and seeing things as they are, while leading me
towards no particular destination. And so, finishing reading it, I feel
I was left at a dead-end.

## Takeaways

-   If there is no eternal life, and if we don't know what's the meaning
    of life, nor will we ever know, why keep living?
-   God, as well as hope are ways around the previous question. Both
    don't give answer, but stir us from the meaningless habit of living.
-   Suicide is the other extreme. If one have freedom of choice, why
    would she keep doing the same thing over and over again, knowing
    what he is doing is futile and has no point, meaning or legacy. Stop
    doing this repetitive thing (i.e. keep leaving the repetitive,
    meaningless, life) is a sound option. But it means caving to the
    absurd, just like believing in god and developing hope.
-   If not God, Hope or suicide, how can one keep living knowing that
    nothing one does adds to something?
-   Camus's answer is to revolt, or, well, keep living live life with
    passion and to the fullest. While the previous point make sense,
    this one is less so, simply because I don't see clearly how it
    translates to real life, and how my day-to-day decisions would be
    affected by it.
-   So, while the absurd makes a lot of sense, and make me realize that
    I'm not the only one who's seeing the absurdity in life, it doesn't
    get me much further. And so, I'm going to acknowledge the absurd and
    keep living my life, probably hoping and dreaming on "some day...".

> "In a sense, and as in melodrama, killing yourself amounts to

> "Living, naturally, in never easy. You continue making the gestures

> "A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar

> illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger."(p.6)

> "We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of

> "Hitherto, ... , people have played on words and pretended to believe
> that refusing to grant a meaning to life necessarily leads to
> declaring that it is not worth living." (p.8)

> "One kills oneself because life is not worth living, that is certainly
> a truth - yet an unfruitful one, because it is a truism. But does that
> insult to existence, that flat denial in which it is plunged come from
> the fact that it has no meaning? Does its absurdity require one to
> escape it through hope or suicide - this is what must be clarified,
> hunted down, and elucidated" (p.9)

> "...during every day of an unillustrious life, time carries us. But a
> moment always comes when we have to carry it. We live on the future:
> 'tomorrow,' 'later on', 'when you have made your way', 'you will
> understand when you are old enough'. Such irrelevancies are wonderful,
> for , after all, it's a mater of dying. Yet a day comes when a man
> notices or says that he is thirty. Thus he asserts his youth. But
> simultaneously he situates himself in relation to time. ... He admits
> that he stands at a certain point on a curve that he acknowledges
> having to travel to its end."(p.13)

> "Living is keeping the absurd alive. Keeping it alive is, above all
> contemplating it. Unlike Eurydice, the absurd dies only when we turn
> away from it. One of the only coherent philosophical position is thus
> revolt." (p.54)

> "It is essential to die unreconciled and not of one's own free
> will."(p.55)

> "... either we are not free and God the all-powerful is responsible
> for evil. Or we are free and responsible but God is not
> all-powerful."(p.56)

> "Before encountering the absurd, the everyday man lives with aims,...
> He weighs his chances, he counts on 'someday'..."(p.57)

> "One becomes so accustomed so quickly. A man wants to earn money in
> order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of a life are
> devoted to the earning of that money. Happiness is forgotten; the
> means are taken for the end."(p.103)

> "If God exists, all depends on him and we can do nothing against his
> will. If he does not exist everything depends on us."(p.108)

Yesterday my blog writing meetup got together. We talked about voice:  
how do you transfer raw thoughts from your brain, to your hands and type
them to the screen without losing their authenticity. How can you make
your writing read as if you were speaking it? How can you make your
readers hear you speaking to them through your posts?

Here are couple of posts we read, as examples for strong sense of unique
voice, which the authors were able to maintain, or maybe convey:

-   [The Kale Was Talking Shit To Me](http://roxanegay.tumblr.com/post/143464148055/the-kale-was-talking-shit-to-me) (by
    Roxane Gay)
-   [Rats](http://www.kinderkamackroad.com/too-cheerful.html?entry=rat) (by
    Joshep Minion)

My biggest takeaway from the discussion last night was that voice
*isn't* something I can think of or plan for when writing. Instead I
*should not* think of it. Only when I won't, my voice *will* find its
way, and slip into my writing.

Holly, on of the group members, put it nicely,  paraphrasing on "Zen in
the Art of Archery"

> Aim away from the target.

If only it was that easy, though...

My memory for faces is bad. I can see someone whom I've met before, but I'll be sure it's the first time we meet. Even worse is my memory for names. It's not that I don't remember names, it just that the names I remember are, most of the times, completely wrong.

> 
> me: "Oh right…"

But like a blind person who compensate with good hearing, I too developed strategies to not make a fool of myself. At least not too often.

As for faces, though, I came up with simple hack. When I'm not sure if I met that person before - always assume that I had. And so I'll say something like "I believe we met before…?"

This is a probabilistic bet, with the following possible outcomes:

1. We actually didn't meet before - a mistake, but not a big one.

2. We did meet and he does remember - win

3. We did meet but she doesn't remember - bigger win!

Based on the expected return, it's clear that if in doubt, the "we met before" strategy is the safest one.

I wish I had better ways to retain that type of information. I would love spending my thinking time on more productive things…

I've just started a new meetup group in NYC. This groups is all about
mechanical keyboards! 

So if you're around (in the NYC area), if you have reminiscences to the
tactile feel and click-clacky noise keyboards used to have when you were
a kid, if you're already spellbound, spending hundreds of dollars in
Massdrop, if you know everything about SA and DSA,  if you're one of the
5% who had their space-bar flipped, if you have just built your own
Ergdox, or if you just want to learn what's all the fuss with those
retro, charming typing devices - [join us](http://www.meetup.com/Click-clack-Mechanical-Keyboard/)!

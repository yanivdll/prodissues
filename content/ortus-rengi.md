Recently I'm into gaming. It started with a nostalgic craving to
Half-Life, which I used to spend hours on, about ages ago. I wondered if
there's a version for mac, and found that there is, in
[Steam](http://steamcommunity.com). I didn't hear about Steam before
(thinking about it, I *did* hear about it in one of the Cortex podcast
episodes), but once visiting that service, there is no way out... a
spent almost the entire night browsing through games, feeling I'm in
an amusement park. I forgot all about half-life, and eventually immersed
myself in [Ortus Rengi](http://ortusregni.com), a closed-deck,
deck-design strategy card game.

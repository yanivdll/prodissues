Couple of months ago I bought the Apple Extended Keyboard from EBay. I
fell in-love with it immediately, and enjoyed typing in it more than I
do with my WASD Code[^1].

To my disappointment, though, few days after I got it, several keys
started to show signs of weakness. The '8' key spouted multiple letters
in every stroke. The 't' worked sporadically, and the '.' stopped
responding altogether.

## First Aid

I looked up how to fix an AEK. Most of the articles I found helped me
with dissembling the case and the board, pulling out key-caps and crack
opening the alps switches. I learned to clean, scratch oxide and
lubricate the switch internals to improve conductivity.

These measures didn't work. I thought about buying a new AEK, but
figured it will make no sense. It's a 30 years old model, and chances
are each keyboard I'll buy will have similar chances of having broken
keys. Yet, this is too good of a keyboard to abandon.


## Intensive Care

And so, I got myself deeper into the world of mechanical keyboards. I
learned that I can desolder switches from the board and replace them
with new ones, but I didn't find alps switches to buy. What I did find
were Matias switches, which claim to be identical to the classic white
Alps switches.

I found a sample pack of Matias switches at
[mechanicalkeyboards.com](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=483).
It includes 5 switches, and costs 5.99\$. I then ordered a [soldering
kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KR1CXTS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage)
from Amazon[^2]. My plan was to replace the
malfunctioned keys. But when I got the Matias switches, I noticed that
they are much clickier than the AEK's alps. I didn't want to have
different typing experience, so I decided to replace the broken switches
with functioning ones from keys I never use. I will then install the
Matias switches for those rarely used keys.

Now that I had a plan, I went on to learn about soldering. I found
through [the
/r/MechanicalKeyboards](http://reddit.com/r/mechanical_keyboards/)
subreddit a series of YouTube videos about soldering[^3]. I think those videos were made around the time my AEK was
manufactured, but they are as timeless as this keyboard. If you're into
it, then take a look also at that video. I found it very helpful in
figuring out how to melt the soldering in order to take off existing
switches, and how to use the soldering pump for sucking away the solder
from the circuit board.

Armed with the acquired knowledge, the whole process turned out to be
easy, quick and actually, quit fun. In less than 10 minutes I had a
renovated keyboard. And now, not only that I have the rolls-royce of
keyboards back in shape, I also know how to take care of it the next
time one of its parts shows signs of fatigue.


## The Gallery

Here are some pictures that illustrate the process (I also included at
the bottom of the article helpful links for further support):

<span class="figure-number">Figure 5:</span> This is how the board looks
from the back. That's where the soldering work will take place. Locate
the soldering that connects the switches we want to remove. Notice the
horizontal lines of solder pairs. Each line represent a row. Each pair
connecting a switch. That should help you locate the switches to work
on.

## Updates: 

-   Few things that I learned from readers, after posting this:
    -   I can find genuine AEK II alps at the
        [/r/mechmarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket) subreddit.
        I looked it out and found someone who have them.
    -   The Matias Quiet Tactiles are the closest match to my AEK
        II keys. Not the Matias Standard Clicky that I bought.
    -   It is possible to replace the clicky leaves in the Matias
        Standard Clicky with the ALPS ones. That will supposadly turn
        the typing experience on the Matias that I have closer to that
        on the alps.

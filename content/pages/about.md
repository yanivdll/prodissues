Hello and welcome to my site. My name is Yaniv, and my weblog serves as a personal experiment with writing, telling stories and sharing the things I'm learning or finding interesting.

This site centers on topics related to product leadership, user experience, and design, but I also write about anything I feel passionate about, such as Apple stuff, productivity, automation and... coffee. I write here for my own amusement, and hopefully you'll find spending time here worthwhile.

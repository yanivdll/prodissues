It took me awhile to find a way to swap the position of two buffers in
emacs. Yes, there is a description in [emacs
wiki](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SwitchingBuffers), and the code
bellow is actually taken from there, but it's not that easy to find
through the tons of irrelevant information around it.

So if you're looking to simply get the right buffer show on the right,
and vice versa, here's what you should add to your init file:


``` lisp
(defun transpose-buffers (arg)
      "Transpose the buffers shown in two windows."
      (interactive "p")
      (let ((selector (if (>= arg 0) 'next-window 'previous-window)))

          (let ((this-win (window-buffer))
                (next-win (window-buffer (funcall selector))))
            (set-window-buffer (selected-window) next-win)
            (set-window-buffer (funcall selector) this-win)
            (select-window (funcall selector)))
          (setq arg (if (plusp arg) (1- arg) (1+ arg))))))
```



I have no idea what this code means [^1], but it
does what I expected it to do. I also didn't create a keybinding for it,
but you can if you would like to. Here's how to bind it to, say, `f8`:


``` lisp
(global-set-key [f8] 'transpose-buffers)
```

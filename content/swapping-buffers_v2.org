** Swapping Buffers

It took me awhile to find a way to swap the position of two buffers in emacs. Yes, there is a description in [emacs wiki](<http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SwitchingBuffers>), and the code bellow is actually taken from there, but it's not that easy to find through the tons of irrelevant information arround it.

So if you're looking to simply get the right buffer show on the right, and vice versa, here's what you should add to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
```elisp
(defun transpose-buffers (arg)
  "Transpose the buffers shown in two windows."
  (interactive "p")
  (let ((selector (if (>= arg 0) 'next-window 'previous-window)))
    (while (/= arg 0)
      (let ((this-win (window-buffer))
            (next-win (window-buffer (funcall selector))))
        (set-window-buffer (selected-window) next-win)
        (set-window-buffer (funcall selector) this-win)
        (select-window (funcall selector)))
      (etq arg (if (plusp arg) (1- arg) (1+ arg))))))
```
#+END_SRC

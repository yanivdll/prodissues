I didn't want to get it. Why?

-   Because I feel awkward to speak to a gadget
-   Because Siri disappointed me, and I don't expect Alexa to be better
-   Because I don't want another computing device that will consume
    *more* of my extincted attention
-   Because I didn't think it can be useful, or help my productivity

But then a certain excuse came my way. Now that we've launched our
[Chatbot for Facebook Messenger](http://m.me/outbrain), and working on
several other messaging platforms, we're ready to explore more channels
to distribute our content. Alexa is one of those next channels. I,
therefore, *need* to buy the Echo, and start experiment with it.

So I did, while telling myself Alexa will stay in the office. I got it
on Friday, just when I was about to leave work. Now, how can I spend the
weekend at home, knowing that there's that gadget sitting lonely on my
desk, back at the office...? so took it to spend the weekend at home
with us. At home, I thought "let's connect it. Just to save setup time,
when I take it back to the office". I did.

Now let's give it a try; see how it works.

So I started talking to it: "Alexa, what's the weather?" - she
understood and spoke the weather in NY to me.

Simple question, probably the most popular one. And yet, the first I've
ever made. She understood and answered. A wave of gratification hits me,
and I'm starting to throw more questions on her: "Alexa, play white
noise" - "here's a sample of 2 hours white noise" "Alexa, stop white
noise" "Alexa, play Billy Joel" - "playing the Billy Joel playlist from
Amazon Prime" "Alexa volume to 6." Too loud... "Alexa, volume 3" "Alexa,
play Jazz", "Alexa, play classic"

Yeah, I'm not being very creative with my requests, but at that point
I'm beyond impressed. Alexa understood everything I said, even when the
music was on; it didn't repeat my requests when it wasn't needed, and
just executed them, the spinning blue light at its top serves as a clear
signal that Alexa is listening.

I like the experience, and eager to learn what else I can do with it.
How quickly did my perception changed...

Few thoughts running through my head:

1.  If it was Apple which build that device... it would have positioned
    as more revolutionary than the iPhone
2.  If\\when Apple will announce a Siri hardware, I don't expect it to
    be better. Siri is already 4 years old, and still doesn't feel
    as mature.
3.  I like the friction-less experience. I do whatever on my computer,
    and Alexa standing there, at the other side of the room,
    always listening. I don't have to switch to another window, or open
    a new tab. I don't have to press a button to get Alexa's attention,
    but simply call it's name.
4.  And here's the most important thing - after this cool experience
    with Alexa, I thought I'm missing something with Siri. So on my
    iPhone, I held-pressed the home button to summon Siri, and said
    "Siri, play Jazz". "You don't have Jazz music" Siri answered. My
    entire music library is in iTune, and I pay for iCloud every month.
    Yet, I don't have any Jazz album in my library, and I don't pay for
    Apple Music. Yet, I have no music on Amazon. What I *do* have is
    Amazon Prime, and with that, I get a product and service that "just
    work" - something that Apple was once very proud of.

Alexa is here, at my home, and will probably stay...

So [we're living in the
future](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/10/21/email-michael-j-fox-today-were-future),
yet I'm traversing the past. It started with this blog, when I decided
to build it from scratch rather than using one of the modern blogging
platforms, such as Wordpress and tumblr. Not only that, but I also
insisted on writing it in pure, static HTML. No real-time rendering, no
dynamic libraries, no Ajax nor server-side scripts. Just HTML, CSS and a
little of JavaScript.

Then, I [stopped using
Evernote](http://prodissues.com/2015/06/why-i-decided-to-move-away-from-evernote.html)
and started to manage my life with plain text files. That transition
opened the door to a search for a new text editor. *New* is just a
figure of speech, because in the course of that search I fell under the
spells of Emacs and Vim, two of the oldest pieces of software out there.

And now, I'm taking another step into the past, to the Internet's cave
era. Instead of embracing Twitter or Reddit (although Reddit *do* start
to win me over), I resorted to... [IRC](http://www.irc.org/).

I won't get into *why* I've started to use IRC, or *what* I find in it
that I don't in modern social networks; I'll do it in a different post.
I'll just note that I'm starting a new journey, a journey of learning. I
have no idea how to navigate and use IRC, let alone how follow its
protocols (technical and communal). I'll have to
[RTFM](https://xkcd.com/293/)...

But the journey I ought taking, is also what attracts me to IRC and all
those archaic beasts. They come with manuals, and I, a simple user, has
to surrender my time and my mind to them, and learn. Read manuals upon
manuals, posts, email lists and discussion boards. Follow the rules of
communication, listen and learn how to interact before pressing to
transmit. Only then, after substantial amount of time, will I feel
comfortable using the basics of the said app/software. Years will pass
by before I will be able to take full advantage of it. It might not
happen during these life, though, so I must be a good servant for a
chance to see the light in the after life.

Yeah, there is something magical, almost religious, with those apps,
their communities and the philosophies behind them. There is something
special in learning, and committing to them. If not the efficiency gain,
then at least the resistance to the modern world that do anything to
[dummify my mind for
attention](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/).

But I've drifted too far already. I suspect the imminent next step will
be to move this site to a
[BBS](http://firstarkansasnews.net/2013/06/no-the-bbs-is-not-extinct/)...

[Ekko](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ekko-Player/id969512337) is a
true "news reader" app - it actually reads the news to you. Not only
will it speak headlines and stories, but it will also listen to your
voice instructions. Say "headlines", and it will read the top headlines;
"play" ^[1](#fn.1){#fnr.1 .footref}^, and it will read an entire
article; "ekko" and it will stop reading and wait for your next
instruction. It's like having Siri as your personal news anchor.

The company that developed Ekko is Intelligence Interactive. It's a
small NYC based startup, and I'm part of its advisory board. My help
revolves mainly around product strategy, and Ekko is the first fruit of
that collaboration. There's hardly anything as satisfying as turning an
idea into a real product, especially one that's getting [warm
reviews](http://9to5mac.com/2015/04/30/ekko-player-ios/).

When you say "play", you should add a keyword from the headline, so Ekko
can infer which headline you're trying to select.

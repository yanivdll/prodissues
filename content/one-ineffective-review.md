Earlier today when I went to grab launch, I came across a lady who stood
at the entrance to a fitness club trying to engage with passer byes. I
think she was an ex-employee or a past customer of this club; either
ways sensed she wasn't very pleased with it. I probably got that
impression because she kept chanting profanities, and urged people to
avoid entering it.

Her scheme worked - no one seemed to enter the place.

Well, if you think about it, this scene took place on 14th street, which
is swarmed with people, especially around lunch time. And so 99.99% of
those people have no intention to get a workout. This lady was trying to
convince the convinced. Or maybe she was hoping that her ferocious
exhortation will keep them from even thinking about it in the future.

But for some reason this surreal sight of this poor lady, who I don't
think is crazy, but who was for some reason offended by something or
someone in this place, so much that she took upon herself to review it
physically and vocally to anyone she could have reached, got me
thinking. It seemed to remind me of something else, but I'm not sure
what.

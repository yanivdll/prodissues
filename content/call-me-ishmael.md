How timely... yesterday I finished [the book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27742061-moby-dick), and today Dropbox Paper already greeted me with this prompt:![Call-me-Ishmael](http://media.prodissues.com/images/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2017-09-25-at-11.54.22-AM.png)

> "It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing children, only found another orphan."

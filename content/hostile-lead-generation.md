In the last few days I've been getting daily emails from TWC, promoting
their "Time Warner Cable Business Class" service. I don't know anything
about this service, and since I don't run a business, its irrelevant to
me. 

Until today I simply deleted those emails, but today I got annoyed, and
made an effort to indicate it by unsubscribing from their mailing list.
However, the unsubscribe flow made me think that TWC isn't really
deterred by requests to unsubscribe. In fact, it seems it's using it as
another user acquisition channel.  
And I think I cracked the protocol of this funnel:

### Marketing emails

Send daily emails to users whose emails we ~~get~~ buy.

Keep sending those emails until the user respond, by clicking on the
unsubscribe link, or selecting the gmail "report spam & unsubscribe"
button.

### Clean user information through an ~~un~~ subscribe form

When a user clicks the unsubscribe link in the email, we have a precious
opportunity to make sure the information we have about this user is
correct.

When a user submit the unsubscribe form, we should update our database
with the new information.

### User is redirected to unsubscribe form

After we get a successful respond from our servers, redirect the user to
the TWC homepage.

We assume (or hope) that when the user submit the form, she moves focus
to another tab, rather than closing the one she've submitted the form
in. If this assumption holds, then the user will have the TWC homepage
waiting for her, and she'll get to it in the near future.

### User visit the TWC homepage

At some point, as we assumed, the user zap through open tabs and open
the one that displays the TWC homepage. Great, we have a new lead! The
user is visiting our site, meaning she's interested in our service.

Hurry up to drop a cookie on her, and look for whatever information we
can get on that cookie. Wait, we have her full name and email address!

### Retarget potential leads

Let's make sure we slice the bread while it's still fresh, and find that
user wherever she browse. This way we can nudge her just a little more,
and try to get her to come back to our site and take another step toward
conversion.

And wait, we have her email! that's gold...

Well, no bad feelings for TWC. It's just an amusing example of the
absurdity of how user acquisition works.

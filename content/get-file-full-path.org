#+DESCRIPTION: 


Here's a small function I borrowed from [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3669511/the-function-to-show-current-files-full-path-in-mini-buffer][this question]] on stack-overflow. It returns the full path of the file I currently edit in the buffer:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun show-file-name ()
  "Show the full path file name in the minibuffer."
  (interactive)
  (message (buffer-file-name))
  (kill-new (file-truename buffer-file-name))
)
(global-set-key "\C-cz" 'show-file-name)
#+END_SRC

You'll note that this function is bind to ~C-c z~. So when typing it, you should see the path showing in the minibuffer. As a bonus, it stores the path in the kill ring, so ~C-y~ (~CMD-v~ works as well on my mac) will paste the value.

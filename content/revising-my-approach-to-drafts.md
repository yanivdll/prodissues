> a blog post is like a news story about yourself

This was an insightful commnet made by Nathan, a member of my Blog
Writing  Meetup. He made this remark in the context of writing style and
voice - he would like to reflect his personality in his posts, rather
than simply report on facts. But thinking about this insight from
another angle might help me understand why I [accumulate so many
unfinished drafts](https://prodissues.com/2015/11/drafts.html), and why
I rarely go back to them.

### News vs. Blog post

> <span class="s1">**News** *(n)***:** newly received or noteworthy
> information, especially about recent or important events</span>

I won't go into explaining news nor will I try to redifine it. I'll
simply assume that if you're reading this post, you can tell a news
article when you see one[^1].

The thing about news is that it's ephermal. No one will care about this
[Apple iPhone 7 release date](http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/iphone/iphone-7-release-date-rumours-uk-new-features-price-specs-launch-pre-orders-start-3530504/) a year from now; or as we joke in my team - chatbots are so April 2016....

Going back to Nathan's comment, I think of a blog post as coverage of
one's thoughts and ideas, a translation of what goes in one's mind. And
so, writing a blog post is really like writing a news story, covering
what's going on in the writer's
head[^2]. And since thoughts and ideas
come and go, not reporting on them in time (obviously, reporting on
those worth noting), makes them stale, irrelevant and less interesting.
Mind you, though, that they become so in the writer's mind, and not
necessarily in the readers'[^3].

### My Drafts Graveyard

It now makes sense why I accumulate tons of drafts, but don't go back to
edit and publish any of them. It's not that they're not good, or not
interesting, but that they're not relevant to me anymore. I lost
interest, as new thoughts are gushing through my head.

When I started this blog, I implemented a writing hack I thought was
useful (I still do) - keeping a [draft section](https://prodissues.com/2015/11/drafts.html) in my blog. Every post I start goes into this section, which suppose to help me capture ideas and serve as a springboard for future posts. In reality, though, it's less a springboard and more graveyard of half backed posts.

### Fight Back

So now that I understand why I never go back to rework on my drafts, it
might be easier to find ways around it. My current approach is to use
the "burn the bridges" strategy [^4], inspired by Sacha Chua's "[Clear out your drafts by scheduling Minimum Viable Posts](http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/02/clear-out-your-drafts-by-scheduling-minimum-viable-posts/)"
post.

The idea is to write a first draft that captures just enough of a
thought to make it understandable. Then, instead of putting it aside and
plan to get back to work on it (which rarely happens), I would schedule
this post to be published in a day or two. Now, I know it's going to go
public and I have no way around it[^5]; I can either iterate on the draft or let it be. But draft it won't be forever.

I use this new strategy with this post, with that very paragraph, which
I'm writing during the grace period before the post published. Next
thing I'm thinking to go through my drafts, and start scheduling few of
them, reminiscence of past time thoughts' news...

I've started to learn touch typing. It's embarrassing to admit that I still haven't learned it, given the amount of time I spend on a keyboard everyday. But it's better to do it later than never.

My goals in doing so are 1) to become more efficient and proficient with
my writing and 2) to reduce friction in my thought process. I want to be able to
capture thoughts as soon and as they appear, and as accurately as possible.

I use an app, called [typist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/typist/id415166115?mt=12), to walk me through the process, and monitor the two main KPIs that infer progress: accuracy (or error ratio) and words per minute (wpm).

Initially, everything went smoothly. I advanced quickly through the exercises,
and felt I'm doing well. I thought it will take no time before I master the new skill. But then, this encouraging trend withered. My improvement stagnated, plateaued, and turned backward. Soon, I typed worst than I did before starting the exercises.

Not knowing how this can happen, I decided to sacrifice speed, and focus, instead, on  accuracy. Once I type fluently, I thought, it will be easier to pick up speed. That didn't work, though. I spent hours trying to type the same paragraph over and over again, as slow as possible, but I just couldn't complete the task without making any mistake.

My conscious attempts to avoid mistakes were also the sole contributors to them. It was as if I had knew a mistake is imminent, and thus imminent it became.

I'm still learning, and fighting my anticipation of mistypings. But I *did* modify my strategy, aiming at crossing this chasm. Instead of focusing on an entire paragraph, I'm now trying to concentrate on only one word at a time, absorb this word, touch type it, return my fingers to the home row, move my attention to the next word, and repeat. This new routine improved my accuracy, and more importantly, redressed the anxious wait for a mistake to happen.

This pattern isn't new to me. I experienced it many times before when acquiring various new skills. It's the accumulation of new knowledge that uncover subtleties I wasn't aware of before. Learning english was, and still is, one such experience. The more I learn, read and communicate, the more aware I become to mistakes I always made but never knew before.

He gets to know all the technical possibilities by which his life may be endangered in combat...", *Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki*

As frustrating as this progress is, I keep reminding myself that those mistakes are signs of improvement and progress. He who does not fail, nor makes mistakes, will not get anywhere.

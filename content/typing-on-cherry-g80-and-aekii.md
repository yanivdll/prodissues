I'm running some typing tests on the AEK and the Cherry g08 with the
black MX switches.

## The Cherry G80

I tried the cherry keyboard before and liked the keys. They are smooth
and linear, and I felt that though they are a bit hard to press, not
having the tactile sensation, actually kind of pushed my fingers up, and
gave them the energy to move to the next key.

On the other hand, I didn't like that the keys feel smaller than those
in my AEK and Wasd code. My hands felt somewhat claustrophobic when
typing, scrambling and twisting to get to the desired keys. Now since I
type in Emacs, it means that I need to use modifier keys quite often.
The layout didn't help either. The bottom row is skewed to the left, so
the modifiers are not aligned under the 'z' and the 'x' as they are in
other, more conventional keyboards.

Apart for the keys, the cherry keyboard is pretty much crap. It's very
light, and feels to be constructed out of cheap materials. The touch-pad
is a jock. It's barely responsive, and won't track my finger unless it
moves slower than it would have taken me to go to the other room and
bring a decent mouse. Overall, though I kinda like the black switches, I
think I'll prefer the browns, which require less force to press. So
overall, this keyboard isn't a keeper.

## Apple Extended Keyboard

And this is now the apple keyboard that I'm typing on, and the first
impression is so much better.

Maybe, my only complaint might be that the keys aren't linear. The
blacks, which are linear feels very good, but they are a little too
hard. It takes just too much force to push down the keys, and keep a
fast typing pace.

Here, with the apple keyboard, typing feels good, but the tactile
feeling is a bit weird. It's like the keys don't seat right, as if they
are not perfectly aligned. The pressing of the key isn't linear. It
feels like there is some kind of a bump the the key pushes through,
which gives a non harmonious tactile feel to the click. It feels like
driving a car on pebbles. Just like you feel those vibrations coming
from the rocky road, that's how they typing on the AEK feels. My fingers
absorb that vibration, caused by the push through this non-linear path
the key does when it's pressed down.

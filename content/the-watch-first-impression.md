I'm sold on it. Yeah, it might be a hasty conclusion based on less than
24 hours with it, but the Watch is here to stay. Well, probably not the
exact one I used, because I passed it over to my wife, trying to get her
drinking the quaalude as well.

First off, I should say that I had very low expectations. I'm not the
kind of guy who's crazy about watches. I don't even know why I'm wearing
one <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. I bought the Apple Watch, and did it so early, simply because I
knew I *will* buy it eventually. After all, I can't resist Apple's
incredible marketing machine. Forking the $350 now, I thought, will save
me the agonizing deliberations and endless reading of equivocal reviews.
And I'm happy I did, because I found it to be a beautiful, useful and
humble timepiece.

Much was already written about [its design](http://9to5mac.com/2015/05/04/review-apple-watch-as-a-design-piece/), so there is no point for me to come up with more superlatives
to describe its allure. Trust me, it looks just like in the pictures - a
charming gadgety garment that will give your hand a bionic yet chichi
and fashionable look.

Aside from design, it's surprisingly useful, exactly when you want it
to. In my company we use [Duo](https://www.duosecurity.com) for security services. Duo has a cool feature that allows you to
authenticate by responding to a push notification on your phone. As cool
as this feature is, you still have to find your phone, usually
scrambling to take it out of your front pocket <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. Getting and
accepting the request using your watch can't be more natural and
convenient.

What strikes me the most about the Watch, though, is its humbleness. Unlike
other devices, it doesn't grapple my attention. I don't turn it on 150
times a day, as I'm conditioned to with my phone. It isn't swamped with
red badges that cry "tap me", and it doesn't vibrate erratically
whenever my mom send a WhatsApp to a family group I've been trying to
mute forever. Obviously, I can make it as obnoxious as I want by
fiddling with the notification settings or loading useless apps. But out
of the box it's as polite as I would have expected such a close and personal
companion to be. It's like, well, a watch. You look at it when you
want to. And when you do, it lits gently to share the time with you.
Simple. And when it *does* have something important to say, it does it
shyly and politely, using its haptic feedback. This is one of those gems
that no one pay too much attention to <sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. The tactile sensation it
emits is so gentle you might mistake it with a human touch.

The one thing that put me off was the learning curve I went through
before getting what each of the knob and gesture do. I'm embarrassed to
say that I had to skim through the short help-page that comes with it.
That's not something I'm used to do with other Apple products.

But overall, I'm happy with the Watch. I think it'll be a good
replacement for my current watch, and I see how it can help me break the
unhealthy ties with my iPhone. Now, all I have to do is get one of my
own, assuming my wife will come up with the same conclusion.

**Update** - She didn't. After 2 days with the watch my wife concluded
that it's beautiful and humble, but not useful enough to justify the
expense.

One writing hack is to read something by someone you admire, before
going about writing. Today, I went on my morning pages right after
reading "[The Tempest](http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=tempest)", one of Shakespeare's most lyrical plays. Here's the outcome...:

I'm on a flight back from a well needed vacation in the Caribbean,
the first, in a long time, which got me to an almost complete
relaxation. I got my sleep deprivation settled, feel refreshed and
recharged, ready to a new adventure. And a new adventure is right by the
corner, hopefully this week its nature I will uncover. Writing
prosaically, a Shakespeare influence it must be, hence can settle the
battle between writing and reading. My mind craves the taste of a good
book, but bloated from the excessive thoughts it has absorbed, with way
not to let them out.

Such fun it is to write this way, encrypting my thoughts, the key to
which known to only me.

What's in me, but a storm? I can't make my mind if I'm an owner or under
someone else's power. I want to make some of my own, yet can't commit
for the sum with which it comes.

I like this muse, it makes me flow, it make my mind fly, sing and play.
Lots of serious business to consider, but I'm going to let my heart take
the final decision.

Here, here, for a fun afternoon astir.

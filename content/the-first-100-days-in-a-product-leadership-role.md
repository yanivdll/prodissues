Asking a candidate for a 100 days plan apparently [becomes the norm](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgebradt/2016/07/27/want-the-job-bring-a-100-day-action-plan-to-the-interview/). As for me, I'm part of this norm. During the final steps in my recruiting process to [Button](http://www.usebutton.com), I created such 30/60/90 days plan.

Drafting this plan was one of the better ways I could prepare for the
new role. It helped me in both setting better expectations for myself,
as for what will be expected of me in those first 3 months, and set a
cadence for progress and execution, right from day one.

As I'm about to hit the first 30 days mark, its time to revisit this
plan, and see where I stand against it. Doing so, I've figured it might
be a good idea to share my plan. Hopefully someone finds it helpful,
and/or share their own ideas.

There are two perspectives through which I think of the different time
horizons in that exercise:

-   Learn, plan, execute
-   Influence myself, my team, the company

Here's a [google doc version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h-0g8ZenD578LlUsCkJ1ndxjX1ovh3o7mn1EdGy5qcE/edit?usp=sharing) of the plan. Feel free to comment, just make sure to add your name to the comment.

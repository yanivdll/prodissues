Tomorrow will be my last day at Outbrain. Here's my goodbye note.

> Hi all, 
> 
> Tomorrow will be my last day at Outbrain.
> 
> I'd like to thank you for being such an important part of my life for the last (almost) 5 years. 
> 
> As there's rarely a single feature that makes a killer product, but rather a combination of capabilities, orchestrated in just the right way to help a user solve a need, the same is true now, when I look to thank the people who've shaped my experience at Outbrain. I can't mention just one or several people, because it's the collection of you all, creating a truly unique culture and atmosphere that makes that company so special. 
> 
> I'm thankful for the privilege to work with and learn from you!
> 
> Keeping in touch with many Outbrain alumni, I know that I can leave Outbrain, but the Outbrain will never leave me :)
> 
> So please don't hesitate to keep in touch and reach out! I'll be a click of a [_button_][2] away.
> 
>  
> 
> Thanks. Yaniv

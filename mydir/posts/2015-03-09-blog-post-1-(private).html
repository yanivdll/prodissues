      <p>Wed, Mar 4, '15
I've recently  decided to improve my writing skills. I subscribed to an (iTunesU course) and did some (reading). But other then putting my mind into it, I didn't do any real progress. I didn't write more, nor did  I practice (I did make an overhaul to my tools… That's always what I'm drown to do first).  I didn't even …</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>All I did was blah blah blah</p>

<p>Mood shift… I was writing this piece while walking my dog (wander what it says about the quality of the writing, and more so considering its subject…). Going back up to my apartment, I've shared the elevator with the CEO of a company that's been trying to recruit me… He don't know me personally (it's the company headhunt that contacted me either), and I don't know him. Yet, to my advantage he wore a name tag. And apparently he's living in my building…</p>

<p>I'll not drill into the company and the opportunity, but this encounter stir my head. Is that a sign? did I think this through? should I rethink whether it's an opportunity I should pursue?</p>

<p>And thus gone away my thought about writing.</p>

<p>No moral or lesson to this post, although I did have one when I started to write it. Maybe that life is so dynamic. You think about one thing, and you're passionate about it. And then you see a random person in the elevator and everything change… so bitten and yet holds true.</p>

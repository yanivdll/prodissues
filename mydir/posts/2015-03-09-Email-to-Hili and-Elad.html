      <p>Hey guys,
Wanted to share with you some of my thoughts following the meetings we had with Gilad, and one that Hili and I had couple of days ago.</p>

<h1 id="walk-through-the-thought-process">Walk through the thought process</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Started from product vision</li>
  <li>To think vision we have to spen time together</li>
  <li>To have time we have to move ourselves from the day to day</li>
  <li>To do so we have to grow our people to me more independent</li>
  <li>That means that what Gilad said in the first meeting did actually make sense</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="problems">Problems</h1>
<p>I see the problems that we experience divided into two types or directions:</p>

<h2 id="upstream---top-management">Upstream - top management</h2>
<ul>
  <li>lack of authority</li>
  <li>prioritization - too many asks and no patient to let things developed</li>
  <li>no definitive KPIs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="downstream---our-product-team-and-rd">Downstream - our product team and R&amp;D</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We don't feel our peers at R&amp;D have the same level of sense of urgency, feel of ownership, motivation as <em>we think</em> we have.</li>
  <li>We don't execute fast enough</li>
  <li>We don't have high standard for what is an MVP let alone product.</li>
  <li>The quality of our product is poor</li>
  <li>We're not proud of the features we're shipping</li>
  <li>Our product don't meet the expectations (at least not the expectations of its stakeholders)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-source-to-these-problems">The source to these problems</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>TRUST</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>the biggest issue that we have to solve for it trust.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Why improving trust is the most important thing</p>

<p>How</p>

<p>Trust is our KPI
This is the only thing that</p>

<p>We must restore the trust</p>
